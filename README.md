# Traditional-ML-techniques-vs-Deep-Learning-technique-for-cancer-detection

# Background
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one of the major causes of death
among women worldwide. Fine-needle aspirations (FNA) are used to examine cells in tumors
and determine if they are benign or malignant. Images can and have been used with machine
learning and deep learning to create classifiers for this purpose.


# Objective
The goal is to use traditional machine learning on a dataset to create classifiers as well as use
deep learning on a separate dataset and compare both techniques.

# Classifiers
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
- SVM


# Python Libs
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Tenslorflow
- Scikit-learn (library for creating the predictive models)

# Prerequisite
- Python >= v3.8
- Jupyter Notebook
- knowledge of Machine Learning
- Knowlegde of Google Colab

# Dataset
